JS Ecosystem

    JS runs on browser - client side
        browser interactivity 
        host objects- window, dom
    
    JS runs on server- back end 
        APIs, databases, etc. 
        node provides host objects 

    Node JS
        cross-platform runtime environment for server-side apps w JS 
        host objects- http, https, etc. 
        use for collaboration tools, games, etc.

        npm - packages to help build projects 

        Express- node framework- build scalable apps, servers ,etc.
            Node limited out of box, so need frameworks 

        command line interfaces- native apps 
            CLI 
            create react app
            airbnb
            instagram 
            VSCode 

            Electron, React 360 can be used to build native apps 

    Front End JS libraries
        React, Vue, & Angular
            React makes UI components, extended to React native
    Server-side- NextJS, NUXT

    Testing JS 

        Unit Tests- expected outcome of each function and test them 
        Libraries for Testing   
            Mocha
            Jasmine 
            Jest- many use w/ React 
            Enzyme- testing for React 


Node Basics

    JS on the server side 
    Node installed on computer
        node -v 
        node app.js // runs file 
    
    console.log // print msg
    console.error // print error msg
    console.dir // print object key/values 

    node
    1+2 //3, can do operations outside browser
    name = "Ben"
    name // Ben

    Native objects- browser and server use
        string, array, date, math 

    Host objects- provided by environment   
        window, document, history, XMLHTTPRequest
    
    Node uses Chrome's V8- Node JS Environment/Platform 

    Most apps do one thing at a time until done- blocking language
        NodeJS, handles requests while others finishing 
            non-blocking, more efficient 

    Use Node.js documentation site- nodejs.org 
        API- objects and methods aka Documentation
