1. How does the internet work?

    -created as a distributed network by DoD
    -all independently operated networks, all designed so any device can connect with any other
    -intenet ships bits- binary inforatmion (bits- on- 1/off- 0)
        -8 bits = 1 byte, 1000 byte = kilobyte, 1000 kilobyte = megabyte
        -send with electricity- on/off counted ex. each sec on is 1
            -send faster = increase bandwidth - max transmission capacity of device
                - measured by bit rate- number of bits sent in time period
                - can also measure latency- amount of time for bit to travel between locations
        -how to send the information
            -  electricity - not super fast & signal loss over distance, copper common
                -send faster as light in fiber optic cable & without signal loss
                - send multiple bits at same time as well, bouncing in cable at different angles
                    - fiber optic cables across ocean floors
            - wireless- use radio signal to send bits 
                -send out as 1s 0s in radio waves, receivers reverse process
                -signal limited distance- ex computer connect to wifi router, than transfers to hard wire to travel 

    

            
2. What is HTTP?

    HTTP Basics
        Hyper Text Transfer Protocol- rules for 2 devices communicating over internet
        Like rules of a conversation
        ex. Client- weather app, server- Node, Apache
        domain name - is at an address, which the servers address (house), server has Internet Protocol address
        http is the language, port # ex. 80 is specific type of comm (http)
        http request is like going to a website in browser
            telnet httpbin.org 80
            GET / HTTP/1.1  // route, 1.1 version
            Host: httpbin.org // URI 
        404 if not found

        HTTP Request format
            Request line- Get or Post [uri] HTTP/[version]
                // get to view, post to change
            Header- [Header Name: [Header Value]
                Host: httpbin.org
                User-Agent: telnet
            // blank line after header
            // request body- for post, info to change

        HTTP Response format
            status line- HTTP/[version] [status code][status message]
                    ex. 404 Not found, 202 Ok, 500 server error, 301 page moved
            headers- [name]: [value] 
                server: nginx
                date: ... 
                content-type: application/xml
            blank line
            response body- xml that comes back or html

        HTTP has no memory of requests- stateless, applications can have the memory

        Sending a GET request
        GET /get?name=Ben&language=English HTTP/1.1 // query string passes additional data
        Host: httpbin.org

        Sending a POST request
            POST /post HTTP/1.1
            Host: httpbin.org
            Content-Length:32

            firstname=Chris&language=English

        Browser is a GUI for HTTP
            enriches HTTP experience

            can see w/ Chrome DevTools
                Network tab- filter for "Doc"/top for initial document
                   general
                        shows html item- http request- url, method, Response, IP address
                    response headers- HTTP version, 200 Ok, etc.
                    request headers
                        show GET etc.

        URL- Uniform Resource Locator- also information to obtain resourc- http://httpbin.org/xml (city state and address)
        URI- Uniform Resource Identifier- /xml (just address)
        HyperText Markup Language- HTML

        can see get request when click a link in DevTools Network

        get request with form-
            method- get, action- URL to send to 
            ex. search bar is a form
            can watch it in DevTools
            transfers search to query string

        send post request with form
            name element on input is sent with value
            in Network on DevTools
                response made into a big query string
                ex. &custemail=abc@123.com& etc.
        
        post request has content type and length required
            query string is below header instead of in request line above header

        cookies- can provide memory
        SSL- can encrypt http - for https website


3. Browsers and how they work

    -browsers are the most widely used software
    -presents the web resource you choose, request from server and display
        -usually HTML/CSS, but also PDF, image, etc.
        -location of resource specified by URI
    -largely same format- address bar, bookmarks, refresh, etc.
    -components
        -user interface- all of window except loaded page
